Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Course Description
------------------

This course deals with mechanics of deformation of the crust and mantle, with emphasis on the importance of different rheological descriptions: brittle, elastic, linear and nonlinear fluids, and viscoelastic.

Prerequisites
-------------

Applications of Continuum Mechanics to Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences ([12.005](/courses/12-005-applications-of-continuum-mechanics-to-earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences-spring-2006)) and either Advanced Calculus for Engineers ([18.075](/courses/18-075-advanced-calculus-for-engineers-fall-2004)) or Mathematical Methods for Engineers I ([18.085](/courses/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008))

Supplementary Texts
-------------------

Malvern, L. E. _Introduction to the Mechanics of a Continuous Medium_. Paramus, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1977. ISBN: 9780134876030.

Assignments and Exams
---------------------

Problem sets will be given out approximately weekly. We will also discuss papers from journals. There will be a take-home final exam.

Grading
-------

Grades will be based 2/3 on the homework, 1/3 on the final.

Collaboration
-------------

You are encouraged to discuss problem sets to help each other on approaches, etc. But do not copy answers - work them out yourself. Do not discuss the exam.
